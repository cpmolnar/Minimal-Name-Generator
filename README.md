# DESCRIPTION
A minimal Name Generator AI built with basic TensorFlow. Use me to generate some unique names!</br>
Intended as a getting-started example of how to implement NLP in TensorFlow.

Big shoutout to Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera for much inspiration.

# USAGE
To install required packages and versions, `pip install -r requirements.txt`</br>
To run, `python names-tf.py`

Simply wait for the model to run through the learning steps, and input the first few characters of a name you 
want to sample.
