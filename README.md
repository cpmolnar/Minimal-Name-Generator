## Description
A minimal Name Generator AI built with basic TensorFlow. Use me to generate some unique names!  
The model learns on a dataset containing 47274 English names, located in the `dataset` folder.  

Intended as a getting-started example of how to implement NLP in TensorFlow.

Big shoutout to Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera for much inspiration.

## Examples
Here are some interesting names the program generated:
- Landentel
- Andasucica
- Celena
- Jiodauch

## Usage
To install required packages and versions, `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
To run, `python names-tf.py`

Simply wait for the model to run through the learning steps, and input the first few characters of a name you 
want to sample.
